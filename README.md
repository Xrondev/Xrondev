# Hello, world! 🥰
> Go coding now.
  
Hi, I am a Computer Science student at HKU, currently working towards obtaining my MSc degree in Computer Science.  
I'm still improving my skill stack in Backend with `Golang`, while I am able to write simple code for the Frontend `Vue3` and Android applications using `Java`.  
Till now, most of my work has been completed using `Python`, I used it for web crawlers (spiders), Machine Learning tasks, or even building backends for some services.

-------
Post an issue if you have any problem with my code!😊  
I have a Blog website, but it is still *under construction🚧*. I am still trying to move all my notes to this site and get familiar with the Hugo. You are welcome to leave a comment using the in-site Giscus system.
